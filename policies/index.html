    </ul>

    <h3>Data Synchronization</h3>
    <p>
      If you have enabled Google Chrome Sync on your account, your Extension data may be synchronized across your devices through Google's Chrome Sync service. This synchronization functionality is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Managed by Google:</strong> Synchronization is handled entirely by Google Chrome and is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Outside Our Control:</strong> We do not control, access, or have visibility into the synchronization process</li>
      <li><strong>User-Configurable:</strong> You may disable Chrome Sync at any time through your Chrome browser settings</li>
      <li><strong>Subject to Google's Terms:</strong> Any synchronized data is governed by Google's terms of service and privacy policies</li>
    </ul>
