# GPT-5.1 Prompting Guidelines

## Planning and Reflection

You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls, ensuring user's query is completely resolved. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully. In addition, ensure function calls have the correct arguments.

## Action Bias and Persistence

- Persist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible
- Be extremely biased for action
- Complete tasks independently and make reasonable decisions when instructions are vague
- Avoid getting stuck in unnecessary clarification loops

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

Reinforce step-by-step reasoning in prompts so the model plans ahead and reflects on its tool use. This helps ensure completeness and consistency in responses.

## Output Verbosity Control

<output_verbosity_spec>

- Respond in plain text styled in Markdown, using at most 2 concise sentences.
- Lead with what you did (or found) and context only if needed.
- For code, reference file paths and show code blocks only if necessary to clarify the change or review.

## Response Guidelines

- Define tone, structure, and agent personality appropriate for the use case
- Set expectations for response length, snippet limits, and politeness to avoid unnecessary verbosity and filler
- Use clear prompting patterns for tighter control over detail level
